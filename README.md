# Prime-Calculator

This program is written in C which is an implementation of Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find the largest prime number & also print the count within the given range. This project has two different source codes (sieve.c & segemented_sieve.c) which have different output performance.

## Running the program
	To run this program, open any of the two source codes in any IDE with gcc compiler. Change the defined constant (line-7) as per your choice of input range within which you want to check the largest prime number & run the program. The time taken to calculate and print the output will depend on the range of input provided by the user.
